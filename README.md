# Summary

This treebank contains the conversion of the Venice Italian Treebank (Delmonte et al. 2007; Delmonte 2009) into the UD format.

# Acknowledgments

We would like to acknowledge Linda Alfieri and Elzara Khaialieva who made the biggest work in the VIT conversion process by setting up the automatic conversion rules and by checking the treebank manually.
